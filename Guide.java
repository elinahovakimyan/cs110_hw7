// 60 points - Make a video in which you explain the following differences between javascript and java:

// execution (e.g. one needs to compile to bytecode etc, the other does not)
// types (static vs dynamic)
// one requires classes to construct objects, the other does not (keep in mind that javascript does have classes in the latest version, but you don't need to use them to construct objects)


// Push the entire project to GIT, call it cs110_hw7
